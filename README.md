# Neural Network from scratch - Using only Numpy

This project aims to reproduce various modules used in PyTorch to enhance understanding of Machine Learning and Neural Networks. It includes visualization of Fully Connected Neural Networks using standard stochastic gradient descent optimization. Future updates will add more networks and visualization methods.

## Overview

- **Visualization**: Fully Connected Neural Networks
- **Optimization**: Stochastic Gradient Descent
- **Future Plans**: Additional networks and visualization methods

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by the YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU
Note that the video explains the process of backpropagation with Numpy while this project extends that knowledge in the form similar to how PyTorch implements backpropagation. 

## Requirements

The following libraries are required:

- `matplotlib` (for visualization)
- `numpy` (for neural network implementation and training)
- `pandas` (to load the MNIST dataset)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
```
